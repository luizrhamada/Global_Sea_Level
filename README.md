# Global Sea Level

Global sea levels are rising as a result of human-caused global warming, with recent rates being unprecedented over the past 2,000-plus years. Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms. This dataset contains the change in sea level since 1993 as observed by satellites.

Col3 - GMSL (Global Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) not applied) variation (mm) with respect to 20-year TOPEX/Jason collinear mean reference
 - It's no application of the global isostatic adjustment that the global mean sea level changes. The TOPEX/Jason 20-year collinear mean refers to the mean sea level value calculated from data collected over 20 years by the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason satellites. These satellites were designed to measure the height of the ocean surface with high precision using radar altimetry.

Col4 - Standard Deviation of GMSL (GIA not applied) variation estimate (mm)

Col5 - Smoothed (60-day Gaussian type filter) GMSL (GIA not applied) variation (mm)
- Smoothed variation of global isostatic adjustment refers to the slow and gradual response of the Earth's crust to changes in surface load, such as the melting of glaciers or the erosion of mountains. This process is part of isostatic adjustment, which is the mechanism by which the Earth seeks to reestablish gravitational equilibrium (isostasy) after changes in the distribution of masses on the surface.

Col6 - GMSL (Global Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) applied) variation (mm) with respect to 20-year TOPEX/Jason collinear mean reference
- Global Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) is a geophysical process that describes the Earth’s slow response to changes in the distribution of surface loads, such as the melting of large masses of ice after the last glaciations. This phenomenon occurs because the Earth’s crust and upper mantle adjust over thousands of years to reach a new isostatic equilibrium as the ice melts and the pressure on the surface decreases.
- When applied to the collinear mean reference, the GIA is used to correct altimetry measurements or sea level changes, taking into account the effects of isostatic adjustment. The collinear mean reference is a reference system that considers the global mean of sea level over time, adjusted for factors such as subsidence or uplift of the Earth's crust caused by the GIA.
- GIA affects sea level measurements because the Earth’s crust may be rising or falling in different regions due to isostatic adjustment. This can create the illusion that sea level is rising or falling locally, when in fact it is the crust that is moving. GIA is used to correct these measurements relative to the collinear mean reference, ensuring that actual changes in sea level are accurately quantified.
- The GIA is crucial to understanding sea level variations on global and regional scales, especially in separating the effects of ice melt and thermal expansion of the oceans from vertical movements of the Earth's crust.
